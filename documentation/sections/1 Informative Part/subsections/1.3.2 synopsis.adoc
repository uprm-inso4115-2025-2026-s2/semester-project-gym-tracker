==== 1.3.2 *Synopsis*
The project aims to develop a centralized fitness tracking system that addresses the fragmentation and inconsistency commonly experienced when managing workouts, running activities, and nutrition. Many individuals struggle to maintain healthy habits because tracking their progress requires multiple tools and excessive manual effort, resulting in frustration and loss of motivation. The proposed system seeks to streamline activity logging and provide clear, structured visibility of progress over time.

By focusing on centralized tracking and measurable progress monitoring, the system will support users in maintaining consistency and reinforcing long-term fitness habits. The project emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and habit reinforcement rather than feature overload. Through structured domain analysis, requirement definition, and validation activities, the project seeks to establish a scalable and requirement-driven foundation for a fitness tracking solution that improves consistency, engagement, and overall accountability in personal fitness journeys.
