== 1.1 Team
The project for Milestone 1 is organized into 5 functional teams, each responsible for a specific dimension of the domain problem. 
The structure reflects the need to address workout tracking, habit consistency, progress evaluation, engagement, 
and user interaction in a coordinated and coherent manner.

The teams operate under a shared objective: to reduce friction in fitness habit tracking and to support long-term consistency 
through clarity, structure, and meaningful feedback. Plus all these teams are the 2 managers. In this context all team members are considered partners. 
No external partners have been identified for this milestone; if any arise, their roles and responsibilities will be documented.

The lists are presented in alphabetical order and indicate each group’s Team Leader. The Tasks column is reserved for recording completed issues. Each 
Team will have it's description and what members participate on it.
