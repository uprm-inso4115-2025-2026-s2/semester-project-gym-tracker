== 1.1 Team
The project for Milestone 1 is organized into 5 functional teams: Workouts, Streaks, Feedback, Notifications, and Accounts and Design; plus 2 Managers.
Each responsible for a specific dimension of the domain problem. 
The structure reflects the need to address workout tracking, habit consistency, progress evaluation, engagement, 
and user interaction in a coordinated and coherent manner.

The teams operate under a shared objective: to reduce friction in fitness habit tracking and to support long-term consistency 
through clarity, structure, and meaningful feedback.In this context all team members are considered partners. 
No external partners have been identified for this milestone; if any arise, their roles and responsibilities will be documented.

The lists are presented in alphabetical order and indicate each group’s Team Leader. The Tasks column is reserved for recording completed issues. Each 
Team will have it's description and what members participate on it. 

==== Managers:

The Managers are responsible for coordination, milestone alignment, and ensuring coherence across all functional teams. 
They support decision-making, documentation consistency, and adherence to project guidelines.

=== Workouts Team:

The Workouts Team is responsible for the domain dimension related to physical activity recording. 
Their responsibility is to ensure that workout sessions, exercise activity, and session-related information are conceptually well-defined and consistently represented within the project’s documentation and reasoning process.

This team focuses on understanding how gym sessions, running activities, and general cardio efforts are described in the real world and how those activities are structured from a domain perspective.

=== Streaks Team:

The Streaks Team is responsible for the domain aspects of habit continuity and attendance consistency. 
Their responsibility is to reason about how repeated participation, missed sessions, and behavioral patterns are conceptualized and measured in the context of fitness habits.

This team ensures that consistency is treated as a domain concept rather than as a mere numerical metric.

=== Feedback Team:

The Feedback Team is responsible for the domain dimension related to goal evaluation and performance reflection. 
Their responsibility is to define how goals are understood, how progress is compared against expectations, and how summaries can represent achievement or deviation at a conceptual level.

The focus of this team is on meaning-making: transforming recorded activity into interpretable progress.

=== Notifications Team:

The Notifications Team is responsible for the engagement dimension of the domain. 
Their responsibility is to analyze how reminders, encouragement, and motivational reinforcement function in the context of habit formation.

This team studies the behavioral implications of prompting and reinforcement without defining implementation mechanisms.

=== Accounts and Design Team:

The Accounts and Design Team is responsible for user identity and interaction coherence at a conceptual level. 
Their responsibility is to reason about how personal history, continuity of records, and usability principles support clarity and reduce friction in the user’s experience.

This team ensures that the project maintains simplicity and structural coherence in how user-related information is understood and organized within the domain.
