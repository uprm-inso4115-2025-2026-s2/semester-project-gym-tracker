=== 1.3 *Scope, Span, and Synopsis*

==== 1.3.1 *Scope & Span*

===== *Scope*
The project operates within the personal fitness and habit-formation domain,
addressing challenges related to workout consistency, progress visibility,
and centralized tracking of physical activity. The project responds to the
observed fragmentation of fitness data across multiple tools and the resulting
decline in user motivation and consistency.

The scope of this project includes:
*Domain Engineering*
- Identification and formalization of key domain concepts such as
  workout session, run, exercise, goal, streak, progress, and activity frequency.
- Documentation of domain behaviors such as logging a workout,
  completing a run, missing a session, or reaching a goal.

*Requirements Engineering*
- Derivation of requirements from identified user needs
  (consistency support, centralized tracking, clear progress feedback).
- Definition of user stories, domain requirements, interface requirements,
  and machine requirements.
- Establishment of measurable criteria for tracking workouts,
  streaks, and goal completion.

*Validation and Analysis Activities*
- Validation of domain understanding and requirements through
  stakeholder reasoning and scenario walkthroughs.
- Evaluation of whether requirements support the identified needs,
  such as reducing friction and increasing motivation.
- Ensuring traceability between needs, goals, user stories,
  and requirements.

===== *Span*
While the scope describes the broad domain of fitness tracking and
habit formation, the span defines the specific focus of this project.

The project targets:
- College students
- Beginner to intermediate gym-goers
- Runners and casual athletes
- Individuals attempting to build consistent fitness habits

The system is intended for individuals who:
- Track gym sessions and/or runs
- Set weekly or daily activity goals
- Benefit from progress summaries and streak monitoring
- Require a simple, centralized tracking solution

The project does not target:
- Professional athletes requiring advanced biometric analytics
- Medical rehabilitation tracking systems
- Professional coaching platforms
- Enterprise gym management systems

The span is limited to personal fitness tracking
and motivational reinforcement rather than elite-level
performance optimization or medical applications.

===== *Out-of-Scope*
To clearly define project boundaries, the following aspects are excluded:

- Detailed software architecture design
- Database schema design
- User interface layout specifications
- Technology stack decisions
- Wearable hardware integration
- Medical diagnostics or injury tracking
- Social media platform functionality
- Financial or gym membership management

The project does not aim to replace professional trainers,
sports scientists, or medical systems. It is a personal tracking
and motivational support tool.
