=== 2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketch

In our brainstorming sessions, we explored the broader issue of maintaining consistency in gym routines and how people experience motivation over time. The discussion frequently returned to the difficulty individuals face in staying disciplined, especially after the initial excitement of starting a new workout routine fades. Several participants noted that many people begin going to the gym regularly but gradually stop due to lack of visible progress, forgetfulness, or declining motivation. A found pattern was the challenge of remembering and tracking what was done during a workout. Some mentioned that they often cannot recall how many times they went to the gym each week or what exercises they performed during their last session. This led to a discussion about how people currently track their workouts — some use note-taking apps, some rely on memory, and others do not track at all.

*Consistency and Streaks*: A significant portion of the conversation focused on consistency. The idea of maintaining a “streak” was repeatedly brought up as something that psychologically motivates people. The term “Duolingo-like” was used to describe how maintaining consecutive days of activity can encourage discipline. At the same time, concerns were raised about how reminders or notifications should be framed, since overly aggressive or judgmental messages might discourage users rather than motivate them.

*Tracking Workout Activity*:  There was also discussion about what aspects of gym activity are important to track. Suggestions included logging total workout time, exercises performed, and possibly calories burned. Someone suggested including a space to write short notes about what was done during a session. Others emphasized that tracking should not become burdensome or time-consuming, since complexity could discourage regular use. The importance of being able to compare sessions over time was mentioned, particularly in relation to noticing improvement or decline. There was also discussion about tracking the days a person attends the gym versus the days they do not.

*Weekly Feedback and Accountability*: Another idea that emerged was the concept of end-of-week feedback. Some participants felt that having a weekly overview of activity compared to goals would increase accountability. The suggestion included showing whether weekly goals were achieved or how far off they were.

The idea of daily versus weekly goals was discussed, with no final agreement on which structure works best.

*Nutrition and Scope Tension*: Nutrition tracking was mentioned multiple times. While some acknowledged that meal logging and calorie intake are related to fitness, many participants expressed concern that including detailed nutrition tracking might overly broaden the focus. Some suggested that nutrition could be treated as a separate concept or even a separate project. There was recognition that the A3 references nutrition, but uncertainty about whether it should be central to the current focus.

Through these discussions, it became clear that the main concern is not advanced fitness analytics, but rather the human challenge of maintaining discipline, remembering to be active, and staying motivated over time.
