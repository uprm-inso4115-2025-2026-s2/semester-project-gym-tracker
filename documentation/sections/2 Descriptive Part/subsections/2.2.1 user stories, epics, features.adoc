=== *2.2 Requirements*

==== *2.2.1 User Stories, Epics, Features*

===== *Epic 1: Workout and Run Logging with Session Details*
As a busy fitness user, I want to log gym sessions and runs with essential details so that I can remember what I did and build a consistent routine over time.

Features::
* Log gym sessions, runs, and basic cardio
* Record session duration and estimated calories burned
* Record exercise types performed
* Optional notes per session
* Edit past sessions to correct mistakes
* Reuse a recent session as a starting point for fast logging

User stories::
* As Alejandro, I want to log a gym session with duration and a short list of exercise types so that I can record my workout quickly and still remember what I did.
* As Derek, I want to log a run with time and distance so that I can track cardio progress alongside my gym routine.
* As Alejandro, I want to copy a recent workout and adjust it slightly so that I do not have to retype the same routine every time.
* As Derek, I want to attach an optional note to a session (for example effort level or injury warnings) so that I can understand context when comparing sessions later.
* As Ana, I want to edit a past session entry so that my weekly summary reflects what actually happened if I logged something incorrectly.
* As Ana, I want to record an optional “how it felt” note after a session so that I can connect progress with how sustainable the routine feels.

===== *Epic 2: Consistency Tracking and Streaks*
As someone trying to build a habit, I want the system to track consistency and streaks so that I stay motivated to keep showing up over time.

Features::
* Track days attended versus missed
* Maintain activity streaks based on regular logging
* Visualize consistency patterns over time
* Treat streak breaks in a way that does not discourage continued use

User stories::
* As Alejandro, I want to see my current streak of active days so that I feel motivated to keep the routine going.
* As Ana, I want to see how many days I was active versus missed in the current week so that I can notice gaps early and adjust.
* As Derek, I want my streak to count both runs and gym sessions so that the tracking matches my real routine.
* As Alejandro, I want weekly progress to remain visible even if my streak breaks so that one missed day does not make me stop tracking.
* As Ana, I want the app to show a “comeback” indicator after I miss a day so that restarting feels like progress, not punishment.

===== *Epic 3: Goals and End-of-Week Feedback*
As a user who needs accountability, I want daily and weekly goals with an end-of-week summary so that I can see whether I met my targets and adjust realistically.

User stories::
* As Ana, I want to set a weekly goal for number of active days so that I have a clear target to aim for.
* As Alejandro, I want an end-of-week summary table showing what I completed versus my goal so that I can feel rewarded and know what to improve next week.
* As Derek, I want to see how far I am from my weekly goal during the week so that I can decide when to fit in a session.
* As Derek, I want to compare this week’s sessions to last week’s sessions so that I can notice improvement or decline without digging through individual logs.
* As Alejandro, I want a simple “goal met / not met” result with a short, supportive explanation so that feedback stays clear and not overwhelming.
* As Ana, I want to optionally add a quick weekly note about what worked or what got in the way so that I can improve my habits over time.

* Supportive tone that avoids judgment
* Basic reminder preferences (enable/disable and frequency)

* Temporary mute or quiet mode

User stories::
* As Ana, I want to enable reminders on days I usually work out so that I get a helpful nudge when I forget.
* As Alejandro, I want reminder messages to feel supportive rather than judgmental so that notifications encourage me instead of discouraging me.
* As Derek, I want to temporarily mute reminders when I am busy so that I do not disengage from the app due to spam.
* As Ana, I want to receive a weekly encouragement message based on my summary so that I stay motivated for the next week.
* As Alejandro, I want reminders to focus on restarting after missed days so that a busy week does not make me give up.

===== *Epic 5: User Accounts and Personal History*
As a regular user, I want my activity history stored in an account so that I can review my progress over time and get consistent summaries.

Features::
* User account management
* Personal workout and run history storage
