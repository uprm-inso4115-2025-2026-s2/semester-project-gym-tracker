= 4 Specific Class Topics

== 4.1 Stakeholder Identification

=== Lecture Definition

According to the Domain Stakeholders lecture, stakeholders are individuals or groups who either:

* Have an *interest* in the domain, or
* *Depend* on the behavior, outcomes, or operation of the system.

The following stakeholder identification applies this definition to the fitness tracking system domain.

=== Initial Stakeholders

The following stakeholder groups were identifiable in the initial project phase based on domain analysis, requirements discussion, and usage scenarios.

==== 1. Primary Users – Gym-Goers / Fitness Enthusiasts

*Interest:*
They seek to log workouts, monitor progress, maintain streaks, and improve consistency.

*Dependency:*
They depend on accurate tracking of Workout Sessions, Goal evaluation, and clear visibility of Progress and Streak status.

These users are directly affected by the system’s ability to represent and evaluate their fitness behavior.

==== 2. Beginner / First-Time Gym Users

*Interest:*
They want structure, clarity, and motivational reinforcement to build consistent habits.

*Dependency:*
They depend on simple tracking mechanisms, understandable feedback, and consistent progress summaries to avoid discouragement.

Their perspective strongly influences scope decisions related to simplicity and usability.

==== 3. Goal-Oriented / Experienced Users

*Interest:*
They aim to achieve measurable targets and evaluate improvement over time.

*Dependency:*
They depend on reliable historical data, comparison of sessions, and meaningful goal evaluation outcomes.

They require that the system preserve data integrity and reflect performance trends accurately.

==== 4. System Administrators / Development Team

*Interest:*
They are responsible for maintaining system integrity, reliability, and alignment with requirements.

*Dependency:*
They depend on well-defined domain models, clear requirements, and predictable system behavior to implement and evolve the platform.

This group influences architectural and technical decisions.

==== 5. Platform Providers (e.g., Hosting / Backend Services)

*Interest:*
They require correct integration, API usage, and adherence to platform policies.

*Dependency:*
The system depends on them for authentication, persistent storage, and uptime.

Though indirect, they are critical external stakeholders due to infrastructure reliance.

==== 6. Future Trainers / Coaches (Potential Expansion Stakeholders)

*Interest:*
They may want insight into user consistency and performance trends.

*Dependency:*
They would depend on structured historical data and accurate summaries if future features allow coaching or review.

While not in initial scope, recognizing them supports long-term domain awareness.

=== Domain vs. Implementation Stakeholders

Primary Users, Beginners, and Goal-Oriented Users are *domain stakeholders* because their interest lies in fitness behavior and outcomes.

System Administrators and Platform Providers are *implementation stakeholders* because their interest centers on system operation and technical realization.

Distinguishing these groups helps ensure that domain modeling remains focused on real-world fitness phenomena rather than purely technical concerns.

=== Alignment with A3 and Project Scope

The identified stakeholders reinforce the project’s emphasis on:

* Workout logging as the core domain activity
* Progress and streak tracking as motivational mechanisms
* Weekly goal evaluation and accountability

Nutrition tracking was intentionally limited in scope based on stakeholder tension observed in early discussions. This reflects alignment with A3 priorities and prevents scope overexpansion.

=== Discovery of Additional Stakeholders

It is likely that additional stakeholders exist beyond those initially identified. To discover them, the team will:

* Conduct informal interviews or surveys with additional gym users.
* Review online fitness communities to identify overlooked needs.
* Revisit domain assumptions during each milestone.
* Analyze feature requests or feedback emerging during development.

When new stakeholders are identified, their interests and dependencies will be documented, and any resulting requirement changes will be reviewed for scope alignment before incorporation.

This iterative identification process ensures that stakeholder analysis evolves alongside the system while maintaining domain focus.
