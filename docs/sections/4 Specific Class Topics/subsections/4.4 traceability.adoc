==== 4.4 Traceability

The purpose of traceability is to set up deliverables so we can answer impact questions (e.g., “if requirement X changes, which goals/personas/tests are affected?”). This section defines the tagging/linking scheme we will use across needs, goals, epics, requirements, and verification. 

===== 4.4.1 Traceability Codes

We will label artifacts with short IDs and reference them inline:

- Needs: N1, N2, ... (from Section 1.2.2)
- Derived goals: G1, G2, ... (from Section 1.5)
- Epics: E1..E5 (from Section 2.2.1)
- Domain requirements: DR1, DR2, ... (from Section 2.2.3)
- Interface requirements: IR1, IR2, ... (from Section 2.2.4)
- Machine requirements: MR1, MR2, ... (from Section 2.2.5)
- Verification checks/tests: V1, V2, ... (from Section 3.2)
- GitHub issues/tasks: GH-### (issue number)

===== 4.4.2 Minimal Traceability Matrix (Milestone 1)

[cols="1,3,2,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Need (N*) |Need statement (Section 1.2.2) |Goals (G*) |Epics (E*) |Key requirements (DR*/IR*/MR*)

|N1
|Unified visibility of activity patterns over time (reduce fragmentation)
|G2, G3
|E1, E5
|DR: Persistent Storage and Retrieval; IR: Recording Real-World Workouts; MR: Availability (core features)

|N2
|Low-effort structured workout logging (reduce friction)
|G4
|E1
|DR: Low-Effort Logging; IR: Interface-Level Validation Constraints; MR: Interactive Response Time

|N3
|Measurable feedback for adherence to goals and summaries
|G2, G5
|E3
|DR: Goal Evaluation; DR: Performance Summary Representation; IR: Goal Initialization and Update

|N4
|Reinforcement mechanisms to support habit formation (streaks + supportive feedback)
|G1, G4
|E2, E4
|DR: Streak Representation + Calculation; IR: Automatic Streak Synchronization; MR: Reliability (data durability)

===== 4.4.3 How We Will Maintain Traceability

- Each requirement section will include a short “Supports: {G*, N*, Persona}” line.
- Each verification item (Section 3.2) will reference the requirement IDs it verifies.
- Each GitHub issue will include the relevant IDs in its description (e.g., "DR3, G2, N1") so work items remain traceable to stakeholder value.

This scheme supports quick impact analysis when requirements evolve during later milestones.
