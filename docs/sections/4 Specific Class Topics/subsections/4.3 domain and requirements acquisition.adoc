=== 4.3 Domain and Requirements Acquisition

This section documents a concrete plan for how we will continue acquiring domain knowledge and requirements beyond the initial brainstorming and informal stakeholder discussions already described in Section 1.4. The guideline explicitly asks for specificity and named resources, not generic statements. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

==== 4.3.1 Acquisition Plan

We will acquire additional domain and requirement information using four complementary streams:

1. *Targeted stakeholder micro-interviews (15–20 minutes each)*  
   We will interview at least:
   - 5 beginner gym-goers (aligning with Alejandro-type constraints),
   - 3 mixed routine users (run + gym, Derek-type),
   - 3 habit-focused users (Ana-type, sensitive to tone/reminders).
   Each interview will be scenario-based (e.g., “log a workout in under 30 seconds”, “weekly goal summary interpretation”) to validate and refine requirements.

2. *Structured survey (quantitative check)*  
   A short survey distributed to UPRM peers to measure:
   - common tracking fragmentation patterns,
   - biggest friction sources (time, complexity, forgetting),
   - desired summary frequency (daily vs weekly),
   - reminder preferences (frequency/tone).

3. *Competitive feature review (existing apps)*  
   We will analyze 3–5 popular tracking apps to extract:
   - minimum viable logging fields,
   - streak/consistency presentation patterns,
   - weekly summary formats,
   - where feature overload increases friction.

4. *Low-fidelity prototype walkthroughs*  
   Once basic screens exist, we will run short “think-aloud” sessions to discover missing requirements at the interface boundary (what users expect to edit, undo, confirm, or see immediately).

==== 4.3.2 Resources and Why We Use Them

We will use diverse resources, as recommended by the guideline: stakeholders + “literature-like” sources + artifact review. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

Primary resources:
- Direct stakeholders: UPRM students, beginner/intermediate gym users, casual runners.
- Existing tools: fitness tracking apps (to identify friction patterns and common mental models).
- Internal artifacts already produced: A3 problem background and countermeasures (to keep alignment with the project’s original problem framing). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

==== 4.3.3 Incorporating New Findings

When new findings affect the domain model or requirements:
- We update terminology and domain narrative if a new concept becomes central.
- We revise epics/user stories if stakeholder goals shift.
- We update domain/interface/machine requirements, and record the reason for change in the logbook and linked GitHub issues.
- We update traceability links (Section 4.4) so changes can be followed from new evidence → updated requirements → updated tests/tasks.
