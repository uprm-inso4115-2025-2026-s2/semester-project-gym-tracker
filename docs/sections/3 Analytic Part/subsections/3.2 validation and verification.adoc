== 3.2 Validation and Verification

To ensure that our fitness tracking system accurately reflects the domain and meets user needs, we have established a structured plan for validation and verification.

=== Validation Activities
Validation ensures that our interpretation of the domain, concepts, and user workflows is accurate.

==== Terminology and Concept Validation
We validate core domain concepts such as Workout Session, Run, Streak, Goal, Consistency, and Progress Feedback by embedding them into concrete scenarios and presenting those scenarios to prospective users.

For example, stakeholders were presented with the following scenario:

“A user completes a 30-minute run in the morning and a 45-minute strength workout in the evening. The system records these as two Workout Sessions on the same calendar date. Both sessions contribute to the users weekly aggregation and streak.”

Participants were asked whether this reflects how they naturally perceive their workouts.

===== Gap identified
Some users initially assumed that only one Workout Session per day was allowed.

=====  Remedy
We clarified the Session Representation requirement to explicitly allow multiple Workout Sessions per calendar date, each treated as a distinct entity while still contributing to weekly aggregation and streak calculations.

=====  Scenario Testing with Stakeholders

Structured scenario walkthroughs were conducted by the development team during the requirements analysis phase. These sessions focused on validating assumptions behind the following requirements:

- Streak Representation and Streak Calculation
- Goal Evaluation
- Weekly Aggregation and Weekly Comparison
- Low-Effort Logging

Example scenario:
    “A user logs workouts on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. They skip Thursday. On Friday, they log another workout. The system computes the streak.”

Stakeholders were asked whether the streak should:

- Continue
- Reset immediately
- Allow a grace period.

=====  Gap identified
Several participants expected some flexibility if a workout was forgotten but performed.

=====  Remedy
We refined the Streak Calculation requirement to explicitly define streaks as sequences of consecutive calendar units. We also documented the possibility of introducing a configurable grace-period feature in future versions.

==== User Experience Surveys
Targeted surveys capture feedback on specific aspects of the system, such as ease of workout logging, clarity of progress feedback, and motivational effectiveness of streaks.

Surveys are distributed at multiple stages, including interactions with low-fidelity prototypes, to validate concepts and refine designs based on user insights.

==== In-System Feedback Tool
A feedback feature within the prototype or app allows users to report issues, suggest improvements, and express satisfaction.

This provides continuous validation, enabling the team to quickly identify usability problems or missing functionality and iterate on solutions.

=== Verification Activities
Verification ensures that the implemented system behaves correctly and satisfies functional and non-functional requirements.

==== Unit Testing for Core Functionalities
Unit tests are written and maintained by the development team and executed automatically upon code updates.

The following properties are verified:

*Session Representation Property*

When a Workout Session is created with:

- A specific calendar date
- Session type
- Duration
- Exercises performed

All attributes are stored and retrieved without modification.

*Persistent Storage Property*

Workout Sessions are retrievable in chronological order after storage.

*Goal Evaluation Property*

If the number of Workout Sessions recorded within a Goal’s Time Frame meets or exceeds the defined target, the system marks the Goal as satisfied.

*Streak Calculation Property*

If a Workout Session is logged on n consecutive calendar days, the system computes a streak value of n.

If one full calendar unit is skipped, the streak resets according to the defined rule.

*Weekly Aggregation Property*

The system correctly aggregates Workout Sessions within calendar week boundaries.

*Weekly Comparison Property*

The system correctly compares the number of sessions in the current week with previous weeks.

These unit tests verify correctness of individual components implementing the domain requirements.

==== Issue Tracking and Resolution
All defects discovered during testing or validation are recorded in a structured issue-tracking system. Each issue is categorized, prioritized, assigned for resolution, and retested.

This ensures systematic verification and controlled system evolution.

==== User Acceptance Testing
Before deployment, representative users execute realistic end-to-end scenarios, such as:

- Maintaining a streak for seven consecutive days
- Logging sessions using only essential information
- Completing a goal within its Time Frame
- Reviewing weekly comparisons

User Acceptance Testing validates that the implemented system reflects the validated domain understanding and satisfies user expectations in realistic conditions.
        
These sessions are observed and documented by the development team.

==== Performance Benchmarking
The system is evaluated against predefined performance criteria.

Properties verified include:

- Workout logging operations complete within acceptable response time under normal usage.

- Weekly aggregation and goal evaluation calculations execute without noticeable delay.

- Retrieval of stored sessions remains efficient for typical user data volumes.

Performance verification ensures that non-functional requirements related to responsiveness and reliability are satisfied.
