== 3.1 Concept Analysis

==== Concept Derivation: Activity Structure

===== From Activity Descriptions to "Workout Session"

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Logging total workout time."
  B: "What was done during a session."
  C: "Exercises performed."

Semantic analysis:

  All three statements refer to a bounded instance of physical activity.
  - Statement A suggests measurable duration.
  - Statement B implies structured content within that period.
  - Statement C suggests internal components of that instance.

Common structure:

  A time-bounded activity composed of smaller activity units.

Abstraction:

  WORKOUT SESSION

Definition:
  A set period of structured physical activity performed by an individual.

Attributes:
  - Duration
  - Set of Exercises

Rationale:
  The abstraction generalizes multiple descriptions into a single domain concept.

===== From Components to "Exercise"

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Exercises performed."
  B: "List of exercise types."
  C: "What was done during a session."

Semantic analysis:

  - Exercises are described as elements within a session.
  - Exercise type differentiates physical activity forms.

Common structure:

  A unit of physical activity that is part of a larger session.

Abstraction:

  EXERCISE

Definition:
  A specific physical movement performed within a workout session.

Relationship:
  - A Workout Session consists of one or more Exercises.
  - Exercise may have Duration.

Justification:
  Exercise is modeled as a part-of relationship within a Workout Session.

===== Distinguishing Attendance from Activity

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Tracking the days a person attends the gym."
  B: "Tracking what was done during a workout."

Semantic analysis:

  - Statement A refers to presence at a location.
  - Statement B refers to tracking the structured physical activity performed during a workout session.
  - Presence does not logically imply structured activity.

Terminology clash:

  Attendance and Workout Activity were implicitly treated as interchangeable.

Resolution:

  Introduce distinct concepts:

    GYM ATTENDANCE
    WORKOUT SESSION

Definitions:

  GYM ATTENDANCE:
    A calendar day on which an individual visits a training location.

  Workout Session:
    A structured period of physical activity.

Relationship:
  - An GYM ATTENDANCE may contain zero or more Workout Sessions.

Justification:
  This separation preserves semantic clarity in the domain.

==== Concept Derivation: Temporal Patterns

===== From Repetition to "Consistency"

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Consistency over time."
  B: "Maintaining discipline."
  C: "People gradually stop going."

Semantic analysis:

  - Statements refer to repeated behavior across time.
  - Focus is not on a single session but on pattern repetition.

Common structure:

  Recurring activity distributed across multiple days.

Abstraction:

  CONSISTENCY

Definition:
  The repeated occurrence of Workout Sessions across time.

===== From Consecutive Days to "Streak"

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Maintaining a streak."
  B: "Consecutive days of activity motivate discipline."

Semantic analysis:

  - The term "streak" implies consecutiveness.
  - Not all repeated activity is consecutive.

Terminology clash:

  The terms "streak" and "consistency" were used interchangeably.

Resolution:

  Distinguish concepts:

    Consistency = repeated activity (non-consecutive allowed)
    Streak      = consecutive activity only

Abstraction:

  STREAK

Definition:
  A sequence of consecutive days containing workout activity.

Relationship:
  - Streak is a specialized form of Consistency.

==== Concept Derivation: Goals and Evaluation

===== From Daily/Weekly Targets to "Goal"

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Weekly overview compared to goals."
  B: "Daily versus weekly goals."
  C: "No agreement on which works best."

Semantic analysis:

  - All statements describe target values.
  - Targets are evaluated within temporal boundaries.
  - Conflict exists regarding granularity (daily vs weekly).

Common structure:

  Target value + time boundary.

Abstraction:

  GOAL
  TIME FRAME

Definitions:

  Goal:
    A predefined target for workout frequency or activity level.

  Time Frame:
    A bounded temporal interval (e.g., day, week).

Higher-level abstraction:

  TEMPORAL GOAL STRUCTURE = Goal + Time Frame

Resolution of clash:
  By abstracting upward, both daily and weekly goals become valid instances of the same structural concept.

===== From Overviews to "Performance Summary"

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Weekly overview of activity."
  B: "Seeing progress motivates people."

Semantic analysis:

  - Overview implies grouping.
  - Motivation is influenced by comparative results.

Abstraction:

  PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

Definition:
  An aggregated representation of workout activity within a specified Time Frame.

Relationship:
  - Compares actual activity to Goal.
  - Influences Motivation.

==== Influencing Domain Factors

===== Motivation

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Declining motivation."
  B: "Streaks encourage discipline."
  C: "Lack of visible progress discourages people."

Common structure:

  Psychological state affecting continuation of workout activity.

Abstraction:

  MOTIVATION

Definition:
  A psychological state influencing sustained participation in  workout activity.

Relationships:
  - Influenced by Streak
  - Influenced by Goal Achievement
  - Influenced by Performance Summary

===== Cognitive Effort

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Tracking should not become burdensome."
  B: "Complexity discourages regular use."

Common structure:

  Mental effort required to remember or reflect on a activity.

Abstraction:

  COGNITIVE EFFORT

Definition:
  The mental energy required to track or recall workout activity.

Relationship:
  - Increased Cognitive Effort negatively affects Consistency.

==== Domain Boundary Definition

Side-by-side rough sketch statements:

  A: "Nutrition tracking is related to fitness."
  B: "Including nutrition might broaden the focus."

Clash:
  Whether nutrition belongs in the same conceptual scope.

Resolution:

  Two domains:

    1. Physical Training
    2. Nutrition Management

Decision:
  Nutrition Management is adjacent but excluded from the core domain model to preserve conceptual cohesion.

This boundary prevents scope expansion beyond the identified core problem: workout consistency.

==== Consolidated Domain Vocabulary

The stabilized domain vocabulary consists of:

  - Workout Session
  - Exercise
  - Duration
  - Note
  - GYM ATTENDANCE
  - Consistency
  - Streak
  - Goal
  - Time Frame
  - Performance Summary
  - Motivation
  - Cognitive Effort

==== Summary

The concept analysis demonstrates that the central domain problem is sustained participation in structured physical training over time.

The domain revolves around:

  - Structuring activity into sessions
  - Repeating activity across time
  - Evaluating progress within temporal boundaries
  - Influencing long-term motivation
  - Reducing cognitive barriers to consistency

All abstractions and concepts were derived from the rough sketch statements, and terminology conflicts were resolved to establish a stable domain vocabulary.
