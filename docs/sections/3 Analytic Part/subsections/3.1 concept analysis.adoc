== 3. Analytic Part

=== 3.1 Concept Analysis

This concept analysis transforms the rough sketch statements from the descriptive part into stable domain concepts, relationships, and terminology. The goal is to show how abstractions were derived (not just the final results).

==== 3.1.1 Concept Derivation: Activity Structure

===== From Activity Descriptions to Workout Session

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Logging total workout time."
B: "What was done during a session."
C: "Exercises performed."

.Semantic analysis
* All three statements refer to a bounded instance of physical activity.
* Statement A suggests measurable duration.
* Statement B implies structured content within that period.
* Statement C suggests internal components of that instance.

.Common structure
* A time-bounded activity composed of smaller activity units.

.Abstraction
*WORKOUT SESSION*

.Definition
A set period of structured physical activity performed by an individual.

.Attributes
* Duration
* Set of Exercises

.Rationale
This abstraction generalizes multiple descriptions into a single domain concept.

===== From Components to Exercise

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Exercises performed."
B: "List of exercise types."
C: "What was done during a session."

.Semantic analysis
* Exercises are described as elements within a session.
* Exercise type differentiates physical activity forms.

.Common structure
* A unit of physical activity that is part of a larger session.

.Abstraction
*EXERCISE*

.Definition
A specific physical movement performed within a workout session.

.Relationships
* A Workout Session consists of one or more Exercises.
* An Exercise may have Duration.

.Justification
Exercise is modeled as a part-of relationship within a Workout Session.

===== Distinguishing Attendance from Activity

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Tracking the days a person attends the gym."
B: "Tracking what was done during a workout."

.Semantic analysis
* Statement A refers to presence at a location.
* Statement B refers to tracking the structured physical activity performed during a workout session.
* Presence does not logically imply structured activity.

.Terminology clash
Attendance and Workout Activity were implicitly treated as interchangeable.

.Resolution: introduce distinct concepts
* *GYM ATTENDANCE*
* *WORKOUT SESSION*

.Definitions
* *GYM ATTENDANCE:* A calendar day on which an individual visits a training location.
* *WORKOUT SESSION:* A structured period of physical activity.

.Relationship
* A Gym Attendance may contain zero or more Workout Sessions.

.Justification
This separation preserves semantic clarity in the domain.

==== 3.1.2 Concept Derivation: Temporal Patterns

===== From Repetition to Consistency

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Consistency over time."
B: "Maintaining discipline."
C: "People gradually stop going."

.Semantic analysis
* Statements refer to repeated behavior across time.
* Focus is not on a single session but on pattern repetition.

.Common structure
* Recurring activity distributed across multiple days.

.Abstraction
*CONSISTENCY*

.Definition
The repeated occurrence of Workout Sessions across time.

===== From Consecutive Days to Streak

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Maintaining a streak."
B: "Consecutive days of activity motivate discipline."

.Semantic analysis
* The term "streak" implies consecutiveness.
* Not all repeated activity is consecutive.

.Terminology clash
The terms "streak" and "consistency" were used interchangeably.

.Resolution: distinguish concepts
* *Consistency:* repeated activity (non-consecutive allowed)
* *Streak:* consecutive activity only

.Abstraction
*STREAK*

.Definition
A sequence of consecutive days containing workout activity.

.Relationship
* Streak is a specialized form of Consistency.

==== 3.1.3 Concept Derivation: Goals and Evaluation

===== From Daily/Weekly Targets to Goal

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Weekly overview compared to goals."
B: "Daily versus weekly goals."
C: "No agreement on which works best."

.Semantic analysis
* All statements describe target values.
* Targets are evaluated within temporal boundaries.
* Conflict exists regarding granularity (daily vs weekly).

.Common structure
* Target value + time boundary.

.Abstractions
* *GOAL*
* *TIME FRAME*

.Definitions
* *Goal:* A predefined target for workout frequency or activity level.
* *Time Frame:* A bounded temporal interval (e.g., day, week).

.Higher-level abstraction
*TEMPORAL GOAL STRUCTURE = Goal + Time Frame*

.Resolution of clash
By abstracting upward, both daily and weekly goals become valid instances of the same structural concept.

===== From Overviews to Performance Summary

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Weekly overview of activity."
B: "Seeing progress motivates people."

.Semantic analysis
* Overview implies grouping.
* Motivation is influenced by comparative results.

.Abstraction
*PERFORMANCE SUMMARY*

.Definition
An aggregated representation of workout activity within a specified Time Frame.

.Relationships
* Compares actual activity to Goal.
* Influences Motivation.

==== 3.1.4 Influencing Domain Factors

===== Motivation

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Declining motivation."
B: "Streaks encourage discipline."
C: "Lack of visible progress discourages people."

.Common structure
* Psychological state affecting continuation of workout activity.

.Abstraction
*MOTIVATION*

.Definition
A psychological state influencing sustained participation in workout activity.

.Relationships
* Influenced by Streak
* Influenced by Goal Achievement
* Influenced by Performance Summary

===== Cognitive Effort

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Tracking should not become burdensome."
B: "Complexity discourages regular use."

.Common structure
* Mental effort required to remember or reflect on an activity.

.Abstraction
*COGNITIVE EFFORT*

.Definition
The mental energy required to track or recall workout activity.

.Relationship
* Increased Cognitive Effort negatively affects Consistency.

==== 3.1.5 Domain Boundary Definition

.Rough sketch statements (side-by-side)
[literal]
A: "Nutrition tracking is related to fitness."
B: "Including nutrition might broaden the focus."

.Clash
Whether nutrition belongs in the same conceptual scope.

.Resolution
Two related domains were identified:
* Physical Training (core domain)
* Nutrition Management (adjacent domain)

.Decision
Nutrition Management is excluded from the core domain model to preserve conceptual cohesion and prevent scope expansion beyond the identified core problem: workout consistency.

==== 3.1.6 Consolidated Domain Vocabulary

The stabilized domain vocabulary consists of:

* Workout Session
* Exercise
* Duration
* Note
* Gym Attendance
* Consistency
* Streak
* Goal
* Time Frame
* Performance Summary
* Motivation
* Cognitive Effort

==== 3.1.7 Summary

The concept analysis demonstrates that the central domain problem is sustained participation in structured physical training over time.

The domain revolves around:

* Structuring activity into sessions
* Repeating activity across time
* Evaluating progress within temporal boundaries
* Influencing long-term motivation
* Reducing cognitive barriers to consistency

All abstractions and concepts were derived from the rough sketch statements, and terminology conflicts were resolved to establish a stable domain vocabulary.
