=== *1.4 Other Activities than just Developing Source Code*

The project does not only consist of implementing a mobile application or web app. 
Before any reliable system can be developed, several foundational 
engineering activities must take place. These activities are necessary 
to reduce ambiguity, align the team, and ensure that the resulting system 
addresses real domain needs rather than assumptions.

==== *Domain Research*

The current situation shows that fitness tracking is fragmented across 
multiple tools and applications. Users often rely on separate systems 
for workout logging, running metrics, and nutrition tracking. This 
fragmentation creates cognitive overload and reduces long-term adherence.

To properly understand this domain, the team conducted:

* Review of existing fitness tracking applications to identify patterns 
  of complexity and feature overload.
* Analysis of habit-formation principles in productivity and educational 
  platforms (e.g., streak systems and visual progress reinforcement).
* Examination of athlete and student behavior regarding workout logging 
  consistency.

The need satisfied by this activity is the need for developers to 
understand the fitness tracking domain independently of the system-to-be. 
Without this understanding, the team risks designing features that do not 
address the real causes of inconsistency.

==== *Stakeholder Interaction*

The primary stakeholders identified for this milestone include:

* College students attempting to maintain gym consistency.
* Beginner to intermediate gym-goers.
* Casual runners and athletes.

Initial informal discussions were conducted with peers who regularly 
attend the gym. These conversations focused on:

* Frustrations with switching between multiple apps.
* Abandonment of tracking tools due to complexity.
* Desire for quick logging workflows.

Planned stakeholder interaction includes structured feedback sessions 
once low-fidelity prototypes are available.

The need satisfied by stakeholder interaction is validation of whether 
the identified pain points reflect actual user experience rather than 
team assumptions.

==== *Concept Analysis*

Through analysis of the problem background and discussions, the team 
identified key domain-level concepts:

* Workout session
* Run
* Streak
* Goal
* Habit consistency
* Progress feedback

These concepts emerged from comparing different user statements such as:
“I forget what I did last week” and “I stop tracking because it takes too long.”

From this comparison, we abstracted higher-level concerns:
* The need for visibility of past performance.
* The need for reduced friction in logging.
* The motivational role of streak continuity.

Concept analysis ensures that the system design is grounded in 
domain phenomena rather than arbitrary feature decisions.

==== *Validation Activities*

Validation at this stage focuses on confirming that the identified needs 
and abstractions correspond to real-world behavior.

The team will validate by:

* Presenting simplified user scenarios to stakeholders 
  (e.g., logging a workout in under 30 seconds).
* Comparing proposed workflows against existing app experiences.
* Evaluating whether streak and weekly summaries improve perceived motivation.

Validation is not intended to obtain approval for a finished product, 
but to test whether the team’s understanding of the domain is accurate.

==== *Connection to Identified Needs*

All activities described above directly address previously identified needs:

* The need to reduce friction in workout logging.
* The need to centralize fitness tracking information.
* The need to reinforce consistency through clear feedback.
* The need to design for habit formation rather than feature overload.

By conducting domain research, stakeholder interaction, concept analysis, 
and validation planning before implementation, the project reduces the 
risk of building a technically functional system that fails to support 
long-term consistency.

No technical implementation decisions are included in this section, 
as its purpose is to document reasoning activities that precede 
development.
