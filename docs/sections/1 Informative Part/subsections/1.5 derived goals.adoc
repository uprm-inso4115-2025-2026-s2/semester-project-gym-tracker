=== *1.5 Derived Goals*

The primary objective of the project is to design a centralized system 
that reduces friction in fitness tracking and supports consistency. 
However, beyond this objective, several secondary goals naturally arise 
from addressing the identified domain problems. These derived goals are 
not functional requirements, but broader outcomes that the project aims 
to support.

==== *Strengthening Long-Term Habit Formation*

A derived goal of the project is to strengthen long-term habit formation. 
If users consistently log workouts and observe their progress over time, 
they are more likely to internalize exercise as part of their identity 
rather than as a temporary activity.

This goal is distinct from merely “tracking workouts.” It focuses on 
behavioral reinforcement and sustainability beyond short-term motivation.

==== *Encouraging Self-Reflection*

Another derived goal is to promote self-reflection regarding physical 
effort, consistency, and improvement patterns. When individuals become 
aware of their routines and gaps, they are better positioned to make 
intentional decisions about their health and performance.

This goal extends beyond logging data. It supports awareness and 
intentional evaluation of personal habits.

==== *Supporting Personal Accountability*

The project also aims to support a culture of personal accountability. 
By maintaining a visible history of actions over time, individuals 
confront objective records of their consistency.

This is not a system feature, but a behavioral outcome: encouraging users 
to take responsibility for their commitments.

==== *Reducing Psychological Friction Around Tracking*

Beyond reducing technical friction, a derived goal is to reduce 
psychological resistance associated with tracking behavior. Many users 
abandon tracking because it feels burdensome or discouraging.

By reframing tracking as a supportive and motivating process, the project 
seeks to shift the emotional relationship users have with habit monitoring.

==== *Promoting a Growth-Oriented Mindset*

A final derived goal is to promote a growth-oriented mindset in which 
progress is evaluated over time rather than judged in isolated sessions. 
This encourages users to value gradual improvement instead of perfection.

This outcome is distinct from the core objective of centralization and 
focuses instead on long-term perspective and resilience.
