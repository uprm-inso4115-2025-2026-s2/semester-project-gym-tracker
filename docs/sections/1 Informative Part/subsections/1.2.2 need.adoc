==== 1.2.2 *Need*

From this situation, several needs emerge within the personal fitness domain. Individuals need a clear and unified understanding of their physical activity patterns over time. Without consolidated visibility, it is difficult to evaluate improvement or identify inconsistency.
Individuals need a low-effort and structured method for recording workouts and related activities. If tracking requires excessive time or cognitive effort, it becomes unsustainable.
Individuals need measurable feedback regarding adherence to their goals. Without structured reflection, missed sessions and incomplete objectives remain abstract rather than concrete.
Individuals need reinforcement mechanisms that support habit formation. Since physical results develop gradually, behavioral consistency must be supported independently of visible body changes.
Beginner and intermediate gym participants need clarity rather than complexity in their tracking environment. Overwhelming tools discourage sustained engagement.
Overall, there is a need for greater structure, visibility, and accountability in maintaining personal fitness routines.
