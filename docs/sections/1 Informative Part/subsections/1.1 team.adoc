=== 1.1 *Team*

The project for Milestone 1 is organized into 5 functional teams: 
Accounts and Design, Workout Data and Logging, Streaks,Notifications and Feedback, and Documentation; plus 2 Managers.

Each team is responsible for a specific dimension of the domain problem. 
The structure reflects the need to address workout data management, habit consistency, motivational feedback, 
user engagement, and interface coherence in a coordinated and well-defined manner.

The teams operate under a shared objective: to reduce friction in fitness habit tracking and to support long-term consistency 
through clarity, structure, and meaningful feedback.

In this context, all team members are considered partners. 
At this stage of the milestone, no external partners (such as domain experts or external stakeholders) 
have been formally integrated into the project. If external partners are identified in later phases, 
their roles and responsibilities will be explicitly documented.

The lists below indicate each group’s Team Leader. 
The Tasks column is reserved for recording completed issues as required by the task tracking policy.

==== *Managers:*

The Managers are responsible for coordination, milestone alignment, task validation, 
and ensuring coherence across all functional teams. They oversee task readiness, scoring, 
and milestone consistency as defined in the course specification.

==== *Accounts and Design Team:*

The Accounts and Design Team is responsible for user identity management and conceptual interface coherence.

Their responsibility includes reasoning about:
- User accounts and authentication concepts
- Personal workout history storage
- Data continuity and ownership
- Structural clarity and usability principles

This team ensures that the project maintains simplicity and coherence in how user-related information is structured 
within the domain.

==== *Workout Data and Logging Team:*

The Workout Data and Logging Team is responsible for the domain dimension related to physical activity recording.

Their responsibility is to define how gym sessions, runs, cardio efforts, and workout attributes 
(duration, calories, exercise type, notes) are conceptually structured and represented.

This team ensures that workout tracking is treated as a domain concept grounded in observable fitness activity, 
not merely as stored data.

==== *Streaks Team:*

The Streaks Team is responsible for the conceptualization of consistency, attendance patterns, and behavioral continuity.

Their responsibility includes reasoning about:
- Consecutive workout tracking
- Missed-session impact
- Habit formation logic
- Visualization of long-term consistency

This team ensures that consistency is treated as a behavioral phenomenon rather than merely a numeric counter.

==== *Notifications and Feedback Team:*

The Notifications and Feedback Team is responsible for motivational reinforcement and goal evaluation.

Their responsibility includes:
- Reminder logic and notification reasoning
- Goal comparison and progress summaries
- End-of-week evaluations
- Conceptual framing of motivational feedback

This team ensures that feedback mechanisms are aligned with habit formation principles and do not become feature overload.

==== *Documentation Team:*

The Documentation Team is responsible for ensuring structural coherence,
clarity, and traceability across all project documentation.

While all developers are responsible for documenting their work,
this team focuses on:

- Maintaining consistency of terminology across sections
- Aligning documentation with milestone guidelines and grading rubrics
- Ensuring traceability between domain concepts, requirements, and tasks
- Reviewing structural integrity before milestone submission
- Coordinating formatting according to documentation-as-code principles

The Documentation Team does not replace individual responsibility for
writing documentation. Instead, it acts as a coordination and quality
assurance layer to ensure that the project deliverables remain coherent,
traceable, and aligned with the course specification.
